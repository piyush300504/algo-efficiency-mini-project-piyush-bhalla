# algo-efficiency-mini-project-piyush-bhalla

What’s here
- src/algorithms.py – basic versions of Fibonacci, sorting (bubble/insertion/selection/merge/quick) and binary search.
- algo_analysis_notebook.ipynb – runs small tests, makes simple plots, and has short notes.
- images/ – plots saved from the notebook.

How to run (Windows)
1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Open the notebook and run cells from top to bottom.

Quick notes
- Recursive Fibonacci slows down after around 25, DP version works faster.
- For tiny lists, simple sorts look okay; for bigger lists, merge/quick are better.
- Binary search needs sorted data.
